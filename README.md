Nand2Tetris
Nand2Tetris: Build a computer system from the ground up, from nand to tetris (nand is the fundamental logic gate to build others gates), from hardware to software.

This Github repository is where I am storing the exercises I completed while reading the book The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles and taking the related courses on Coursera.

project 1: Logic Gates -> Starting from an elementary NAND logic gate, built an array of more complex logic gates, i.e., And, Or, Mux, Xor, etc.
project 2: ALU -> Constructed an adder chip and ALU, which executes all the arithmetic and logical operations
project 3: Registers & Program Counter -> Used a D Flip Flop circuit, which enables storing state in a chip, to construct a series of registers and a Program Counter
project 4: Assembly -> Wrote Assembly Language programs using the Hack Machine Language
project 5: Full Computer -> Constructued CPU, ROM, and RAM units leading to a full scale Computer
project 6: Assembler -> Created Hack assembler in C++ to translate Hack Assembly Language into Hack Binary Machine Language
